0,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,He said the way my blue eyes shined,1
1,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,2
2,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"I said, ""That's a lie""",3
3,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Just a boy in a Chevy truck,4
4,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,5
5,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,On back roads at night,6
6,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And I was right there beside him all summer long,7
7,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,8
8,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,But when you think Tim McGraw,9
9,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think my favorite song,10
10,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The one we danced to all night long,11
11,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,12
12,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think happiness,13
13,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think that little black dress,14
14,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Think of my head on your chest,15
15,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And my old faded blue jeans,16
16,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think Tim McGraw,17
17,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think of me,18
18,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,September saw a month of tears,19
19,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And thankin' God that you weren't here,20
20,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,To see me like that,21
21,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,But in a box beneath my bed,22
22,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Is a letter that you never read,23
23,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,From three summers back,24
24,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet,25
25,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe",26
26,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think Tim McGraw,27
27,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think my favorite song,28
28,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The one we danced to all night long,29
29,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,30
30,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think happiness,31
31,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think that little black dress,32
32,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,Think of my head on your chest,33
33,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And my old faded blue jeans,34
34,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think Tim McGraw,35
35,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think of me,36
36,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And I'm back for the first time since then,37
37,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I'm standin' on your street,38
38,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And there's a letter left on your doorstep,39
39,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,And the first thing that you'll read is:,40
40,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"""When you think Tim McGraw",41
41,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,I hope you think my favorite song,42

43,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,"I hope it takes you back to that place""",44
44,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,1,When you think happiness,45

174,Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,I've never been anywhere cold as you,8
175,Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray,9
176,Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away,10
177,Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,And you come away with a great little story,11
178,Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you,12
179,Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day",13
180,Taylor Swift,Cold As You,5,"So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say",14

199,Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,This ain't the best view,11
200,Taylor Swift,The Outside,6,On the outside looking in,12
