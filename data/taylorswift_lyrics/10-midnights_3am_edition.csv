Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,When the morning came,2
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf,3
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,'Cause we lost track of time again,4
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,Laughing with my feet in your lap,5
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,Like you were my closest friend,6
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say,7

Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,And I chose you,10
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The one I was dancing with,11
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,In New York, no shoes,12
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,Looked up at the sky and it was,13
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The burgundy on my t-shirt,14
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,When you splashed your wine into me,15
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,16
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,So scarlet, it was,17
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The mark thеy saw on my collarbone,18
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The rust that grew bеtween telephones,19
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The lips I used to call home,20
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,So scarlet, it was maroon,21
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,When the silence came,22
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,We were shaking, blind and hazy,23
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,How the hell did we lose sight of us again?,24
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,Sobbing with your head in your hands,25
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,Ain't that the way shit always ends?,26
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway,27
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us,28
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,I feel you, no matter what,29
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The rubies that I gave up,30
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,And I lost you,31
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The one I was dancing with,32

Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The mark they saw on my collarbone,39
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The rust that grew between telephones,40
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,The lips I used to call home,41
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,So scarlet, it was maroon,42
Midnights (3am Edition),Maroon,1,And I wake with your memory over me,43

Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser,2
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,Midnights become my afternoons,3
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people,4

Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,And I'm a monster on the hill,18
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city,19
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,Pierced through the heart, but never killed,20
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism,21
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,Like some kind of congressman?,22
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,I wake up screaming from dreaming,23
Midnights (3am Edition),Anti-Hero,2,One day, I'll watch as you're leaving,24
