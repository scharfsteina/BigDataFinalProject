Can it?\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift]\nAre we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)\nWeird, but fuckin' beautiful\nFlying in a dream (Flying in a dream)\nStars by the pocketful\nYou wanting me (You wanting me)\nTonight feels impossible\nBut it's comin' down\nNo sound, it's all around\n\n[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey]\nLike snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)\nLike snow on the beach (Flying in a dream)\nLike snow on the beach (You wanting me)\nLike snow, ah\nBut it's comin' down\nNo sound, it's all around\n\n[Outro: Taylor Swift]\nLike snow on the beach\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\nLike snow on the beach\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)30Embed"
